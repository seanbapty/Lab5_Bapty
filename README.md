# Part 1
The program in part 1 begins by loading 8 into the accumulator. It then adds 1 to the accumulator value and outputs it onto port 3. The program continues to loop adding 1 until 9 reaches 0 in 2s compliment hex. Once 0 is reaced the program no longer "jumps negative" and therefore does not increment anymore.
